My two favourite keybinds, which I would argue are the two most important and most powerful keybinds, are "alt+enter" and "ctrl+shift+a", and, if you can consider it a keybind, "tab"
"alt+enter", also called the intent menu, is an intelligent, context-aware, and developer's-intention-aware menu that will list a variety of features that the stidio can do for you to make your life easier, based on where you use the command. This includes creating common functions, declaring variables, modifying your code, and other macro-like features, such as unwrapping an if statement.
"ctrl+shift+a" is an amazing "search everything android studio" tool. It can be used to open your edit history without having to navigate your structure or explorer, create new files, from new activities to new layouts, and even begin the debugger.
The most powerful shortcut has to be the simple "tab". You cannot call yourself a programmer if you dont regularly abuse the tab's auto-fill function. And as someone who is obnoxiously obsessed with efficiency, I wouldnt be able to stand developing in an environment without a tool like it. A simple three keystrokes like "on"+tab can write you entire blocks of code.
